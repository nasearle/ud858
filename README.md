### Using the Application:
To use the application go to [delta-entity-114022.appspot.com](delta-entity-114022.appspot.com).
From the homepage you can log in, edit your profile, create conferences, and view and edit conferences.

#### Task 1: Design Choices Response
New Session and SessionForm classes were created in models.py. The Session class is an ndb model 
that maps its properties to corresponding properties of Session entities in Datastore. All properties
in the Session class are string data types except date and startTime, which are date and time types. 
This was the simplest solution for storing the data. If necessary, data can then be converted to the 
correct type for operations in filters after retrieving it from Datastore. SessionForms is a protorpc
Messages class that defines the response-parameters for an external call to the application. All 
fields of SessionForm are string types, which are converted to the correct data types upon the 
creation of a new Session entity (date and startTime are converted to date and time data types).

The createSession endpoint takes the websafeConferenceKey as a parameter. It passes the 
websafeConferenceKey to the createSessionObject function. The function copies the data in the 
request to a dictionary object, converting the date and time fields to date and time data types, and 
'puts' the data to Datastore in a new Session entity. The websafeConferenceKey is used to make the 
conference object the parent of the new session object. Finally, if the session-creator entered a 
speaker, a push task is created to check if the speaker will become the new featured speaker.

The getConferenceSessions, getConferenceSessionsByType, and getConferenceSessionsBySpeaker endpoints
each take the websafeConferenceKey as a parameter, which is used to get the conference object from
Datastore.  We then query for all sessions with this conference as the ancestor, and apply filters
in the cases of getConferenceSessionsByType and getConferenceSessionsBySpeaker.

#### Task 3: Additional Queries
I added two additional query types: getConferenceSessionsByDuration and getConferenceSessionsByTime.
getConferenceSessionsByDuration takes as input a time (in minutes e.g. '120' for 2 hours) and returns
all sessions of that duration. getConferenceSessionsByTime takes as input a time of day (24-hour time
e.g. '13:00') and returns all sessions at that time.

#### Task 3: Query Problem
The not-equal (!=) filter is implemented by combining two inequality (>, <) filters joined by an OR 
operator. In Datastore, an inequality filter can be applied to at most one property per query,
so applying "Session.type != workshop" and "Session.startTime < 7pm" wouldn't work. One solution 
would be to put the results from a query using one filterinto a temporary table and apply the other
 filter in a query of this new table.
